Hello World Program for the Entex Adventure Vision

## Building

This project is written in 8048 assembly, so to build this, you will need an 8048 cross-assembler.  The only open-source one I know of is asm48, which can be found here: https://daveho.github.io/asm48/

## Running

I use MESSUI to test, which can be found here: https://messui.1emulation.com/.  You will need to run the Adventure Vision emulator and then mount the binary.

Adventure Vision cartridges are just EPROMS housed in plastic cases which plug directly into the unit.  There isn't even a PCB involved.  So if you have an actual hardware unit, you could of course attempt to burn the binary to an EPROM and run it (at your own risk of course).  

## Other

I have not yet tested this on the actual hardware but plan to do so at some point in the near future.
